# Steno Source Code

Source code in this directory is divided up into the following types:

- **Command**: containing code/programs/scripts that run functionality from
  certain applications (mostly macOS-based). These scripts are then run directly
  from a dictionary. More details in the [Custom Command README][].
- **Japanese Romaji**: containing a [Python][] Plover dictionary that translates
  Plover-like chords to Japanese _[romaji][]_. More details in the
  [Japanese Romaji README][].
- **[Plover Plugins][] Config**: containing source code config for the following
  plugins:
  - [Plover Layout Display][]: I created a layout for the [Georgi][] keyboard.

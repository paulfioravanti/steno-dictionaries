# Typey Type

The [bash][] file contained in this directory was initially taken from
[Save Typey Type Progress][], and I have only made some minor changes.

The outline I used for this was not originally defined in my own dictionary, but
taken from [Di's Steno Dictionaries][], specifically from the
[`computer-powerups.json`][] dictionary: `TAO*EUPZ`.

> I ended up adopting the convention of "Application name brief + `*Z`" for
> outlines related to running application base functionality or switching to
> said application.

The script is referenced in the [`command.md`][] dictionary.

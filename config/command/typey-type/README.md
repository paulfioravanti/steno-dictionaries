# Typey Type Custom Commands

The files and [Alfred][] workflow files contained in this directory were
initially taken from [Save Typey Type Progress][], and I have only made some
minor changes.

The outline I used for this was not originally defined in my own dictionary, but
taken from [Di's Steno Dictionaries][], specifically from the
[`computer-powerups.json`][] dictionary:

- `"TAO*EUPZ": "{#Control_L(Alt_L(Super_L(Shift_L(t))))}"`
  via a <kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>T</kbd> complex
  shortcut.

## Bash Files

In the event that you do not use Alfred, then the file containing the
bash `(.sh)` code used in the workflow Run Script items are included for use
in your command handling software of choice (eg [Automator][] etc).

## Overrides

The following are outlines that override existing Plover theory outlines to
output a phrase.

They are where I _personally_ think an existing Plover outline would be better
mapped elsewhere. They are subjective entries since they essentially diverge
away from Plover theory.

Comments after the entries indicate the original Plover entry.

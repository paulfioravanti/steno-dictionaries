# Cycleable Entries

The following outlines all leverage the [Plover Cycle Translations][] plugin to
make their translations cycleable to any existing [homophones][], [proper
nouns][], alternative spellings, or other words I may deem "relevant".

The first word in the cycleable word list is the one whose outline is
overridden.

The "selector stroke" I use to cycle between the words in the list is:

```yaml
"R*R": "=CYCLE:NEXT"
```

<!-- vim-markdown-toc GFM -->

* [New](#new)
* [Alternative](#alternative)
* [Overrides](#overrides)

<!-- vim-markdown-toc -->

## New

The following are outlines for _new_ word entries that are not currently
contained in Plover theory. These cycleable entries override [New entries in my
Words Dictionary][]

```yaml
"AERPB": "=CYCLE:erne,earn,urn"
"HAO*EU": "=CYCLE:hie,high,hi"
"HRA*EZ": "=CYCLE:laze,lays,lace,leis"
"KHO*EL": "=CYCLE:Kohl,kohl,coal,cole,Cole"
"KHOURD": "=CYCLE:cowherd,coward,cowered"
"KO*EUPB": "=CYCLE:quoin,coign,coin"
"KO*URS": "=CYCLE:corse,course,coarse"
"KRO*EL": "=CYCLE:cole,Cole,coal,kohl,Kohl"
"KROEUPB": "=CYCLE:coign,quoin,coin"
"KWRAO*EFS": "=CYCLE:Yves,eaves,eves"
"KWRAOEFS": "=CYCLE:Yves,eaves,eves"
"PWO*URPB": "=CYCLE:Bourne,bourn,borne,born"
"PWRA*EUZ": "=CYCLE:Braze,braze,braise,brays"
"PWRA*EZ": "=CYCLE:Braze,braze,braise,brays"
"RA*ED": "=CYCLE:rede,read,reed"
"RA*PD": "=CYCLE:rapped,wrapped,rapt"
"RAO*/-D": "=CYCLE:rood,rude,rued"
"TP*URZ": "=CYCLE:furze,furs,firs"
"TPA*EPB": "=CYCLE:fane,feign,fain"
"TPAEPB": "=CYCLE:fane,feign,fain"
"TPAEUR/ROE": "=CYCLE:pharoah,Pharoah,farrow,faro"
"TPAR/RO*E": "=CYCLE:farrow,faro,pharoah,Pharoah"
"TPEURZ": "=CYCLE:firs,furs,furze"
"TPHO*S": "=CYCLE:noes,nose,knows"
"TPRO*E": "=CYCLE:faro,farrow,pharoah,Pharoah"
"TPURZ": "=CYCLE:furs,firs,furze"
```

## Alternative

The following outlines are overrides to _alternative_ outlines for word entries
that already exist in Plover theory. These cycleable entries override
[Alternative entries in my Words Dictionary][].

```yaml
"PHRA*EURPB": "=CYCLE:planar,planer,plainer"
"PHRAEURPB": "=CYCLE:plainer,planer,planar"
"PO*ERL": "=CYCLE:poler,polar,poller"
"PO*RL": "=CYCLE:poller,poler,polar"
"PWA*EUFS": "=CYCLE:basis,bases,basses"
"SAO*UBGS": "=CYCLE:Sioux,sue,Sue,sou"
"STKAR": "=CYCLE:cedar,ceder,seeder"
"TKAO*EUR": "=CYCLE:dyer,dire,dier"
"WHO*EUL": "=CYCLE:wholly,holy,holey"
"WHOEUL": "=CYCLE:wholly,holy,holey"
```

## Overrides

The following outlines technically override the ones in Plover: not because
I think they would be better mapped elsewhere, but just because I want to make
their translations cycleable. They also could override [Overrides entries in my
Words Dictionary][].

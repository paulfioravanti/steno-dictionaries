# New Dictionary

This dictionary contains new outline entries that _do not_ currently have a
named entry in Plover's [`main.json`][Plover main.json].

They are divided into the following dictionary types:

<!-- vim-markdown-toc GFM -->

* [Words](#words)
* [Phrases](#phrases)
* [Proper Nouns](#proper-nouns)

<!-- vim-markdown-toc -->

## Words

These entries contain any _new_ word. I have tried to make the new outline make
"intuitive sense" for a Plover user: the outline is phonetic and/or the outline
_generally_ follows Plover's rules.

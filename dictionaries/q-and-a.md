# Q&A Dictionary

The [Q&A Python dictionary][] contains outlines related to switching between
different people or lines of questioning in a conversation.

More information about the concept of [Q&A][] can be found at:

- [Platinum Steno Lesson 27 QA video][]

More information about the creation of, and reasoning behind, the outlines in
this dictionary can be found at the following blog post:

- _[Plover For the Record][]_

The outlines might only really be applicable for court reporting, but since
there are Q&A exercises in the Platinum Steno lessons, I have attempted to
port their outlines to Plover (download the
[lesson 27 materials][Platinum Steno Lesson 27 lesson materials] for free to see
the briefs they use).

For completeness' sake, outlines for other speakers who do not typically come up
in Q&A, but are used by court reporters (The Videographer, The Court Reporter,
The Clerk, and The Bailiff), have been added in. The outlines come from two
sources:

- the [Platinum Steno Theory Dictionary (NCRS Theory)][], which would seem to
  potentially be derived from the theory used by the
  [National Court Reporters Association][] (NCRA)
- outlines I derived (read: made up) from the `STPHAOEUFPLT`-based outlines for
  The Court (since the Videographer, Court Reporter, Clerk, and Bailiff work
  with or for the Court, I figured their outlines could be grouped together)

Use whichever outlines feel comfortable to you, or make up new ones entirely
like I did!

# Steno Dictionaries

This repository contains my personal stenography dictionaries, and
some non-dictionary steno-related source code for [Plover][].

Details regarding the dictionaries and source code can be found under their
respective directories (`dictionaries` and `src`).

The dictionaries are mostly in [Markdown][] format, with a bit of [JSON][] (see
[Plover Plugins section](#add-plover-plugins) for how to use Markdown
dictionaries). They either use, or are intended to supplement, Plover theory,
and _generally_ not be in conflict with
[Plover's default `main.json` dictionary][Plover main.json].

## Blog Posts

More information about these dictionaries and what led to their creation can
be found in the following blog posts I wrote:

- _[Going Platinum][]_
- _[Plover For the Record][]_

Persistent steno practice using [Typey Type][] was a massive factor in gaining
the confidence to be able to feel like I could supplement Plover entries with my
own content. I wrote about working with Typey Type here:

- _[I Completed Typey Type][]_

You can read all about the formulation of the [Doom Typist][] dictionary, and
how steno gaming is possible, here:

- _[Steno Gaming: Doom Typist][]_

## Sibling Repositories

In order to make coding a more joyous experience with steno, I take advantage of
snippets to help me write code boilerplate more quickly and flexibly. My
snippets are made with [Ultisnips][], and the repo containing them can be found
here:

-  [Vim Snippets][]

I am currently working on a Japanese language theory that can be used with
Plover, which I call _Chidori_. Some outlines in these dictionaries reference
it, and so the repo containing the dictionary can be found here:

- [Chidori][]

## Setup

### Clone repository

In your terminal program, use [Git][] to clone the repository from its home on
[Github][]:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:paulfioravanti/steno-dictionaries.git
```

### Import Dictionaries

Use Plover's Open Dictionaries functionality to choose one or more dictionaries
to import into your dictionaries list.

### Add Plover Plugins

In order for some dictionaries to work, particular [Plover Plugins][] will
need to be installed. Click the Plover Plugins Manager button on the Plover
user interface to show the list of installable plugins.

Install a plugin by selecting the plugin name from the list and clicking the
"Install/Update" button.

- [Plover Dict Commands][]: Needed in order to use outlines that enable typing
  raw steno (see my [Plover Control Commands][] dictionary)
- [Plover Layout Display][]: Needed in order to use my [Georgi][]-inspired
  [layout config][]
- [Plover Markdown Dictionary][]: Needed in order to use any of the dictionary
  entries that are embedded in [Markdown][] files (`.md`)
- [Plover Q&A][]: Needed in order to use my Q&A-related outlines
- [Plover Run Shell][]: Needed to use the outlines that can control applications
  on your computer (see [`command.md`][] for examples)
- [Plover Stitching][]: Needed to use my custom [stitching][]-related dictionary
  outlines (ie [`stitching.md`][])
- [Plover Emoji][]: Aside from the occasional few I have made custom briefs for
  in my [`emoji.md`][] dictionary, I leverage this plugin for every other
  emoji, and can recommend installing it

### Create Environment Variable

In order to use many of the outlines in [`command.md`][], you will need to
define a `STENO_DICTIONARIES` environment variable in your `~/.bashrc` file (or
`~/.zshrc`, or whatever [configuration file][] your [shell][] uses) containing
the value of the path that this directory is in.

For example, I have my `steno-dictionaries/` directory located inside a
`steno/` directory under my user account's home directory. So, in my
`~/.bashrc` file, I have an entry that looks like:

**`~/.bashrc`**

```sh
# Enable call outs to scripts in steno command dictionaries.
export STENO_DICTIONARIES="$HOME/steno/steno-dictionaries"
```

Change the path value to wherever you have cloned this directory, and the
commands should work as expected.

### Compile Applescript Files

Outlines in dictionaries containing commands that run an [AppleScript][] file
reference compiled `.scpt` versions of the `.applescript` files contained in
this repository.

Those compiled `.scpt` files are not contained in this repository by default.
If you are using these scripts for the first time, in order to generate the
`.scpt` files, run the following script in the root directory of this repository
which will do it for you:

```sh
./bin/bootstrap
```

If you decide to make changes to the logic in the Applescript files, remember to
re-generate the `.scpt` files by running the command below to recompile them.

```sh
./bin/compile-applescript-files
```

If you want to just remove all the `.scpt` files for whatever reason, run the
following script:

```sh
./bin/remove-scpt-files
```

# Steno Dictionaries

This repository contains my personal stenography dictionaries, and
some non-dictionary steno-related config for [Plover][].

Details regarding the dictionaries and config can be found under their
respective directories.

The dictionaries are in [JSON][] format, and either use, or are intended to
supplement, Plover theory, and _generally_ not be in conflict with [Plover's
default `main.json` dictionary][Plover main.json].

## Blog Posts

More information about these dictionaries and what led to their creation can
be found in the following blog posts I wrote:

- _[Going Platinum][]_
- _[Plover For the Record][]_

Persistent steno practice using [Typey Type][] was a massive factor in gaining
the confidence to be able to feel like I could supplement Plover entries with my
own content. I wrote about working with Typey Type here:

- _[I Completed Typey Type][]_

## Hat Tips :tophat:

Inspiration for additions have been:

- [Di's steno dictionaries][]
- [Platinum Steno][] video course

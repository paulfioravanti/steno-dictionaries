# Steno Dictionaries

This repository contains my personal stenography dictionaries.

The dictionaries are in JSON format and either use, or are intended to
supplement, [Plover][] theory, and not be in conflict with [Plover's default
`main.json` dictionary][Plover main.json].

Inspiration for additions have been:

- [Platinum Steno][] video course

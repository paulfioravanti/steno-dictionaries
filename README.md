# Steno Dictionaries

This repository contains my personal stenography dictionaries.

The dictionaries are in JSON format and either use, or are intended to
supplement, [Plover][] theory, and generally not be in conflict with [Plover's
default `main.json` dictionary][Plover main.json].

Outlines where I have a strong enough preference for them to use them over the
ones that Plover provides are contained in the [`overrides.json`][] dictionary.

Inspiration for additions have been:

- [Platinum Steno][] video course
